# School Projects
Interesting projects completed during Computer Science course work.

This repository contains relevant coding projects completed throughout my Computer Science course work.
Projects range from the beginnings of my coding adventure up to the present.

More to come!

### text_adventure.cpp
- A simple text-based adventure game in C++!
- Runs in the command prompt.
- Bound to have some bugs still.
- First sizable project that I tackled while learning to code!

### msh.c
- A simple shell in C for Linux environments.
- Some commands still need to be implemented, such as ! for example, and will be added later.
- To exit msh, type "exit"
- Now supports single use of ; or |
- Local aliases have been added: there are still some bugs in this section of the code so tread lightly for the time being
- Path updating supported
- History will now show with the command 'history'
- If you include a file named 'mshrc' in the same directory as the executable once compiled, it will run the commands found in mshrc
- More features and support to come!

### mlstone.sml
- A cheesy text-based version of a card game like Hearthstone
- Created in ML using the SMLNJ interpreter
- Tested and run in a Linux environment, so it may need some tweaking to work elsewhere
